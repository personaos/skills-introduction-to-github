# 👋 Welcome to PersonaOS

Hi there — I’m building **PersonaOS**, an offline-first, privacy-respecting AI assistant designed to run entirely on your own hardware.

I'm passionate about decentralizing AI and enabling local, voice-based assistants that are modular, extensible, and free from cloud dependency.

## 🔧 Projects

### 🧠 [PersonaOS](https://github.com/PersonaOS/personaos)
> A fully local, modular AI assistant OS.

- 🎤 Speech-to-text (Whisper)
- 🧠 Local LLMs (llama.cpp, Mistral, GPT4All)
- 🔊 Text-to-speech (Piper/Coqui)
- 🗃️ Memory and personality modules (in development)
- 🤖 Optional robotics & embodiment interfaces

---

## 🧰 Tech I'm Using

- **Python** – for scripting the AI pipeline and integration
- **llama.cpp / Ollama** – for local language models
- **Whisper.cpp** – for real-time, offline voice recognition
- **Piper / Coqui TTS** – fast, high-quality local speech synthesis
- **Git + GitHub** – for version control and collaboration
- **Intel NUC** – my development hardware for local deployment

---

## 🛠️ Current Focus

- Building a voice-interactive LLM pipeline
- Designing modular components for AI OS use cases
- Optimizing for latency on low-power machines
- Developing memory, tool-use, and robotic extension modules

---

## 💡 Goals

- Enable anyone to run a personal AI assistant locally
- Prioritize privacy and user control over convenience
- Create an open-source alternative to cloud-based AI agents
- Support integration with real-world sensors, robots, and smart devices
